# go-akavelink

ðŸš€ A Go-based HTTP server that wraps the Akave SDK, exposing Akave APIs over REST. The previous version of this repo was a CLI wrapper around the Akave SDK; refer to [akavelink](https://github.com/akave-ai/akavelink).

## Project Goals

  - Provide a production-ready HTTP layer around Akave SDK
  - Replace dependency on CLI-based wrappers
  - Make it easy to integrate Akave storage into other systems via simple REST APIs

## Dev Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run `go-akavelink` locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/akave-ai/go-akavelink
    cd go-akavelink
    ```

2.  **Get Akave Tokens and Private Key:**

      * Go to the Akave Faucet: [https://faucet.akave.ai/](https://faucet.akave.ai/)
      * Add the Akave network to your wallet.
      * Claim your tokens.
      * Obtain your private key from your wallet.

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your `go-akavelink` directory with the following content, replacing `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE` with the private key you obtained:

    ```
    AKAVE_PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE"
    AKAVE_NODE_ADDRESS="connect.akave.ai:5500"
    ```

4.  **Run Setup Script (Recommended):**

    The `scripts/` directory contains helper scripts (`setup.sh` and `setup.bat`) to automate the environment variable export process.

    **For macOS/Linux:**
    Navigate to the `scripts` directory and give execute permissions, then run the script:

    ```bash
    chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
    ./scripts/setup.sh
    # Or if you prefer bash specifically
    # chmod +x scripts/setup.bat
    # ./scripts/setup.bat
    ```

    This script will export the variables from your `.env` file into your current terminal session. To verify, you can run:

    ```bash
    echo $AKAVE_PRIVATE_KEY
    echo $AKAVE_NODE_ADDRESS
    ```

    These variables will persist for your current terminal session. For permanent environment variables, consider adding them to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile`).

    **For Windows PowerShell:**
    You might need to adjust your PowerShell execution policy to run scripts. Open PowerShell as an administrator and run:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

    Then, you can run the script (note: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is recommended for running `.sh` scripts on Windows for a more native experience):

    ```powershell
    # If using PowerShell directly, you might need to execute it like this:
    # powershell -File .\scripts\setup.ps1  (assuming a PowerShell equivalent script)

    # However, for .sh or .bat scripts, it's best to use Git Bash or WSL.
    # If you have Git Bash installed:
    # bash scripts/setup.sh
    # Or, manually export variables as described below if you prefer not to use WSL/Git Bash:
    Get-Content .env | ForEach-Object {
        $line = $_.Trim()
        if (-not ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($line)) -and -not $line.StartsWith("#")) {
            $parts = $line.Split('=', 2)
            if ($parts.Length -eq 2) {
                $varName = $parts[0]
                $varValue = $parts[1].Trim('"') # Remove quotes if present
                [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($varName, $varValue, "Process")
                Write-Host "Exported variable: $varName"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    To verify they are loaded in your current PowerShell session, you can run:

    ```powershell
    Get-Item Env:AKAVE_PRIVATE_KEY
    Get-Item Env:AKAVE_NODE_ADDRESS
    ```

    These variables will persist for this PowerShell session. For permanent environment variables, refer to Windows documentation on setting system or user-specific environment variables.

5.  **Install Go Modules:**
    Before running the server, ensure all Go modules are tidy and downloaded:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

6.  **Run the Server:**

    ```bash
    go run ./cmd/server
    ```

    You should see output similar to:

    ```
    2025/07/07 03:17:14 Starting go-akavelink server on :8080...
    ```

7.  **Verify Installation:**
    Visit `http://localhost:8080/health` in your web browser to verify that the server is running correctly.
